alt="Making hedge fund investment strategy easily accessible. Is it able to beat passive investment?&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 2008, Warran Buffett issued a challenge to the hedge fund
industry, the fee will not justify the performance, over a period of ten years.
His <span class=MsoHyperlink><a
href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/buffetts-bet-hedge-funds-year-eight-brka-brkb.asp">won
the bet in 2015</a></span> when Ted Seides conceded the defeat early. In the
past decade, passive investment strategy popularized by use of ETF, has been
gaining market share at expense of not just Hedge fund industry, once a darling
in investment world, but also active managed investment in general. Passive
investment formally surpassed active management in <span class=MsoHyperlink><a

2019</a></span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the classic strategy of hedge funds is to use
macro-economy data to predict future movement of stock price. Today, not just
macro- economy could be readily accessible, some data of the frequently used
strategies, such as Treasury price and yield, market sentiment as such investor
sentiment survey, are publically accessible and available. By using data
science and machine learning techniques, we could </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Back
test the performance of those strategies.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Proof
or disapprove if these strategies have potential to beat passive investment.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis
of factors used in the strategy.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis
of machine learning techniques and their bias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We elected three major categories of data and choose a
representative one in each category, to determine the predictive power of the
data to future stock price movement. There are infinite ways to model the
problem. In order to be able to fit into machine learning techniques, with many
of them are classifiers, we choose to use the level of current data, to predict
the price movement direction of future stock price, at a specific period in the
future, either going up, or going down. This model allow to provide binary
classification and give us large amount of data, as each day of data can be a
data point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three categories are chosen:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Macro-economy
data: Conference Board Leading Economy Indicator, which is published monthly,
is chosen representative in this category.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternative
investment, e.g., bond or Treasury: 10 Year Treasury Internet Rate, which is
considered the benchmark of all asset pricing and is considered a safe
alternative to stock investment, is chosen in this category. This data is
published daily.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sentiment
survey: Association of Individual Investors Sentiments, which publish weekly is
one of the oldest measure of investor sentiment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We choose three machine learning classifiers: SVM, Decision
Tree, and Na&iuml;ve Bayes, and use accuracy and precision scores to measure their
performance. For benchmark, passive investment strategy is used. It essentially
predicts every day is a good day to buy and never sell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also separate data set into past and future, and optimize
the model based on past data, and predict into future. It is important in the
time series data that we cannot use future to predict the past, as it violates
the logic in the real world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our findings indicate:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SVM
perform the best, Decision Tree give just as good result as SVM. Naive Bayes
can be a bit unpredictable and have wider score variations.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SVM,
and Decision Tree comes close, but not able to, beat the passive strategy. The score
of passive strategy is indicated by dash lines in above graph.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
Decision Tree is a good enough model, we take advantage of it being able to
provide the feature weight analysis, and look at the contribution to the weights&nbsp;
from the three categories. Leading Economic Indicator has majority of the
weight, with Treasury Interest Rate not far behind. Sentiment data contribute
to some but far less weight in this analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decision
Tree is interesting in that it has huge difference between the score of
training data and testing data. Overfitting occur very often for this model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We demo a simple analysis using machine learning techniques
to analyze investment strategy. In the way we choose to model the problem, and
the machine learning techniques for analysis, it comes to a conclusion that
appear to match what happen in the real world, e.g., all strategies are not
able to beat a simple passive, buy and hold investment strategy. However, this
is by no mean conclusion, as different way of modeling the data, and choose
different period of time in the history, could potentially give widely varying
results. The analysis does give as objective way to measure the performance of
investment strategies, in a world where the choice of strategies are often
subjective.</p>
